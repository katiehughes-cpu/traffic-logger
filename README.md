### What is it?

Use your BBC micro:bit as a data-logger to survey things you see, like different kinds of traffic or wildlife, or answers to questions.

At the press of a button, the micro:bit records what you have seen and stores the data in a table so you can analyse it later.

Data stays on your micro:bit even if you disconnect the batteries or USB cable, so you can study it when you're back at your computer.
